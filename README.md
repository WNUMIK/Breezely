# Breezely: Web-Based Advanced Weather Application

**Breezely** is a web-based weather app built using Python and Flask. It provides real-time weather data, forecasts, historical weather trends, and air quality information for various locations. This project demonstrates proficiency in Python development, web frameworks, and API integration, while also showcasing version control and collaboration using GitHub.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Weather & Forecast**
   - Fetch current weather data for any city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description.
   - Display a 7-day weather forecast on the webpage.
   - Provide severe weather alerts (e.g., storms, heatwaves).

2. **Historical Weather Data and Trends**
   - Visual representation of weather trends (temperature, humidity, and precipitation) over 7, 30, and 365 days.
   - Interactive charts using Plotly or Chart.js.

3. **"Best Day" Feature**
   - Allows users to pick an upcoming date and compare it to historical data to find the most suitable day for outdoor activities.

4. **Air Quality Index (AQI)**
   - Fetch AQI data for any location and display it alongside health recommendations.
   - Color-coded AQI indicators for better visualization (green = good, red = hazardous).

5. **Personalized Recommendations**
   - Based on weather data and air quality, the app provides contextual suggestions (e.g., "Great day for a run" or "Consider staying indoors due to poor air quality").

6. **Global Weather Dashboard**
   - Monitor weather conditions for multiple cities in a clean, interactive global dashboard.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**: Core language used for development.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework used to build the web interface.
- **Pipenv**: Used for dependency management and virtual environment.
- **Requests**: Used for making API calls to OpenWeatherMap for weather and AQI data.
- **Plotly/Matplotlib**: Libraries used for creating interactive data visualizations (weather trends).
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive web design and user interface styling.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breezely.git
   cd breezely
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using Pipenv**:
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```bash
     touch .env
     ```
   - Add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
     ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   pipenv run flask run
   ```

5. **Open the app**:
   Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to view the Breezely app.

## Deployment (Optional)

To deploy Breezely to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku), follow these steps:

1. Install `gunicorn`:
   ```bash
   pipenv install gunicorn
   ```

2. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory:
   ```
   web: gunicorn app:app
   ```

3. Push the repository to your Heroku app:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```
